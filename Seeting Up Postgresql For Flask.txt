After downloading and installing postgresql from this url https://www.postgresql.org/download/ and setting up a username and password. Do the following:
Step 1: Open pgAdmin and connect to your server then create a new database.
Step 2: Go to your project directory using gitbash, activate it and pip install the following packages:
        pip install Flask-SQLALchemy # This is the orm for interacting with your database
        pip install psycopg2 # This is the postgres adapter for python languages.
Step 3: Open file containing your page routes e.g. app.py and put the following lines:

        from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
        
        # NB: After app = Flask(__name__) line insert the code snippets bellow
        # Database Connection String.
        app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'postgresql://username:password@localhost/databasename' # username and password are for postgres.
        db = SQLAlchemy(app)

Step 4: Based on your uml class diagram create the classes. I will give one as an example NB:we are still on the same file:

        # Creates the User table with two Columns id and username
        class User(db.Model):
            id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
            username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True)
            
            def __repr__(self):
                 return "<User %r>" % self.username

Final Step (Creating the tables): Go to your active working directory on gitbash and type the following:

        $python
       >>from app import db # app is the name of the python file where your classes are located.
       >>db.create_all()

And boom!! your tables are up and runing. Just login to your pgAdmin and confirm.
